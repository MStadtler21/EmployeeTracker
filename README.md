# EmployeeTracker


The SQL employee tracker is a simple application that allows us to interact with SQL databases, and add to those existing databases.

The application gives us a lisiting of employees, departments, and unique id's associated with those employees. A user can add, delete, and modify employee profiles.

This application uses MySQL, Node, and a few smaller packages like inquirer.
